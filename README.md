# js-fractals
This project uses a modified version of plasma.js (https://gist.github.com/rochal/2839478), and a coffeescript/modified version of Jame Patterson's Julia Set library (@jamjar919).

I made this just for fun, I may try to add smooth transitions between the generated images, and a not-random Julia Set change, so the generated pattern has some connection with the previous one.

Help and suggestions are always welcome.
